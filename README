Very Rough Video Editor, by Theo Watson
Needs Love!

Files:
Put the movies in /bin/data/movies/  Note: You might need Perian to playback FLV files. 
Make sure you have a frames/ folder in bin/data/ 

Keys, 
'e' to Edit the video clips in and out points. Use mouse position to scrub the play position.  
'm' to Rearrange the order of the clips 
'r' to randomize clip order
'l' to load saved clip order
'p' to play the video as it is
'P' ( CAPS ) to render the video the the frames/ folder

currently the frame time is fixes as a static value at the top of testApp.cpp 
this could be made different per clip. 

NOTE: when it is rendering out the video it renders it out slowly so as to not skip frames. 
If you try to render it out at full speed then you will get skipped frames and an inconsistent fps. 

To turn back into a movie import the frames/ folder as an image sequence into QuickimePro - make sure to use the FPS that is in the OF app.
